A simple app that shows the current weather in the selected location.

What I learned while working on this project:


How to utilize the async/await syntax,

How to send requests to a server using an API key,

How to pull information from the server in the form of a JSON file,

How to retrieve the relevant information from the JSON file and display it on the page.
